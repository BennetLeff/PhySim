#PhySim
This project plans to be a physics simulator. It is written in D using Derelict's OpenGL bindings. Currently only the graphics backend is being written. This is a work in progress and features are constantly being added.
#To-Do's
The project is still young however a good chunk of necessary code for the graphics backend has been written. 
- [x] Meshes, Textures, Shaders, Prefabs
- [x] Transformations
- [x] User Input plus Camera Movement
- [ ] Basic Lighting (<s>Point Lights</s>, Directional Lights)
- [ ] Shadows
- [x] Start working on Physics
- [ ] Past physics, TBD

#Learning Resources
I've decided to compile a growing list of helpful resources I've used inorder to help others learn and attribute credit to code I've learned from tutorials.
